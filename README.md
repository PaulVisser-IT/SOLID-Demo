# S.O.L.I.D Principles

In this project I demonstrate the use of the S.O.L.I.D principles. These guide programmers toward building more loosely coupled and maintainable software.

(S)ingle Responsibility - Each class and function should have only one specific task to perform.

(O)pen / Closed - Functonality (classes, methods etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

(L)iskov - Any subclass object should be substitutable for the class object from which it is derived.

(I)nterface Segregation - A client should not be exposed to methods (through interfaces) that it does not need.

(D)ependency Inversion - High level modules should not depend on low level modules, they should depend on abstractions.
